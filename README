Work in progress.

- BitcoinScript.v
An attempt at a formalized (pure functional) specifcation of Bitcoin 
transaction validation, etc. A 'correct-by-construction' Tx validator (ocaml 
or Haskell code) can be extracted from the specification. 

- Examples.v
The main point of this formalization is to help prove 'theorems' about the 
bitcoin script language. A few examples are provided. In particular, it's 
possible to quantify over families of scripts, showing them to be
unsatisfiable, or to show two families of scripts equivalent to each other.
